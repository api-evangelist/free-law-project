  Free Law Project is a non-profit organization that seeks to increase access to
  justice and transparency in the legal system through the use of technology and
  open data. They provide free, public access to a wealth of legal information,
  including court opinions, statutes, and regulations. They also offer tools for
  legal research, such as RECAP, which helps users access and analyze court
  documents. In addition, Free Law Project works on projects to promote
  accountability and improve the functioning of the legal system, such as
  monitoring judicial transparency and tracking the influence of money in
  politics. By making legal information more easily accessible and usable, Free
  Law Project aims to empower individuals, journalists, and researchers to
  better understand and navigate the law.
